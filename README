=Scraping data=
To scrape precinct level results you can run the included scraper.rb. This will produce a precincts.csv file in the local directory. The scraper relies on ruby 1.8 and FasterCSV. The data is scraped directly from the chicago board of elections. 

=Mapping=
To generate the maps you'll need to have a recent (2.10 or greater) install of R and the following packages: 
 - maptools
 - ggplot2
 - RGDal (probably optional )
 - RColorBrewer

The precinct level shapefiles were pulled from the city of chicago GIS site and are stored in the Precincts subdirectory. Big thanks to them for having accurate precinct-level shapefiles readily accessibly. 
The R code uses ggplot to actually create the graphics, and was heavily based off an entry in the ggplot wiki (https://github.com/hadley/ggplot2/wiki/plotting-polygon-shapefiles). Thanks to whomever put that together.
